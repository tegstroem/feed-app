# Project- overview 
-name: feed-app

An app for photographers to showcase their work with others who can save and rate their
photographies. Design is minimalist in black and white for artists to properly exhibit 
how they work with light and color. The app uses a swipe right function to imitate the
feeling of looking through a porfolio book.
